## Apply Object oriented principles/patterns
TODO: Superior use of object oriented principles/patterns; use of OO principles/patterns throughout application with positive impact on code maintainability and serviceability

## Employ and utilise proper source control methodology
1. Project files exist on a git repo
2. README and gitignore with appropriate content
3. multiple feature branches with commits from all team members
4. demonstrates frequent commits, merges and pull requests from all team members

## Employ and utilise project management methodology
TODO: Excellent use of task delegation with Kanban board of tickets assigned to team members labelled with difficulty level and corresponding Git commits and demonstrating consideration of strength and weaknesses of team members and project/team conditions.

## Employ and utilise task delegation methodology
Simple and clear standards for planning methodology chosen and adhered to.

## Use of Arrays
TODO: Shows thorough understanding of the use-cases of Arrays and utilises them to solve a problem unsolvable otherwise.

## Use of Objects
TODO: Understands, utilises and manipulates Objects using a range of methods to benefit the solution.

## Database schema
TODO: Creates a well constructed Database schema that contains methods which meaningfully contribute to the solution.

## App functionality
TODO: Builds an outstanding application, that meets client and user needs and exceeds expectations

## Deployment
TODO: Successfully deploys to a cloud hosting service, uses environment variables, use same database type in development/testing as production, uses custom domain name

## User interface
TODO: User-interface is highly intuitive, with no impediments to user flow.

## Testing 
### Development testing
TODO: Evidence of extensive user-testing of development site
### Production testing
TODO: Evidence of extensive user-testing of production site, including by client
### Formal testing framework
TODO: Comprehensive test suite including both unit and integration tests in both backend and frontend, with at least 90% code coverage
