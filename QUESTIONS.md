# MERN Stack Project - Git Answer

Final project of coder academy by [Edward Deam](https://github.com/EdwardDeam), [Tony Xu](https://github.com/DesignTX) and [Owen Shepard](https://github.com/owshepherd)

## Description of libraries used in the app.

TODO: Excellent use of libraries and a complete and detailed description of he libraraies used in the app.

## Provide an overview and description of your source control process.

Our source control was based around the git / github workflow. We created two repositories on GitHub, for the Node/Express Server and one for the React app. We used multiple feature branches so that individual work wouldnt have an impact on the main working code, and made an effort to make frequent commits so that it was easy to see what changes where made if something went wrong.
In addition to this we added [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). This utility integrates with GitHub and runs `npm test` on a virtual server. This final check made sure that all tests would still pass with the new code before it was merged.

## Demonstrate sound design architecture

TODO: Shows almost flawless understanding of the high level structure of the app

## Design of ERD

## Datafow Diagram

TODO: Provides dataflow diagram(s) that strictly follow the standard convensions to clearly identify the processes within your application. Clearly depicts where data is coming from, where it is going and how it is being stored.

## OO Design

TODO: Provides Object Oriented design diagrams(UML or alternative) that clearly identify OO class attributes, methods, relationships.

## Provide UX/UI design documentation(user stories) that adequately show Agile methodology implementation.

TODO: Provides multiple user stories that use ‘persona, what and why’ that outline meaningful features of project. Shows evidence of user story revision and refinement.

## Planning Methodology

TODO: Simple and clear standards for planning methodology chosen and adhered to

## Provide UX/UI design documentation(wireframes) that adequately show Agile methodology implementation.

TODO: Provides wireframes that show exceptional planning of project flow and structure including but not limited to space distrobution, content prioritisation, intended actions, functions, relationships between screens.

## Demonstrated code flow control

TODO: Flawless code flow control: documented test coverage/successful results for all user stories, including corner cases

## Apply Object oriented principles/patterns

TODO: Superior use of object oriented principles/patterns; use of OO principles/patterns throughout application with positive impact on code maintainability and serviceability

## Employ and utilise proper source control methodology

1. Project files exist on a git repo
2. README and gitignore with appropriate content
3. multiple feature branches with commits from all team members
4. demonstrates frequent commits, merges and pull requests from all team members

## Employ and utilise project management methodology

TODO: Excellent use of task delegation with Kanban board of tickets assigned to team members labelled with difficulty level and corresponding Git commits and demonstrating consideration of strength and weaknesses of team members and project/team conditions.

## Employ and utilise task delegation methodology

Simple and clear standards for planning methodology chosen and adhered to.

## Code Style

TODO: The code adheres to all team standards. The code is exceptionally well organised and very easy to follow. Comments are complete and useful; variables' and functions’ purposes are clearly communicated by their names.

Use a style guide or linter as team.

## Validation of data (including ranges)

TODO: All data is expertly validated using a range of techniques(e.g. regex, etc) and checked; demonstrating an exeptional level of understanding.

## Use of Arrays

TODO: Shows thorough understanding of the use-cases of Arrays and utilises them to solve a problem unsolvable otherwise.

## Use of Objects

TODO: Understands, utilises and manipulates Objects using a range of methods to benefit the solution.

## App functionality

TODO: Builds an outstanding application, that meets client and user needs and exceeds expectations

## Deployment

TODO: Successfully deploys to a cloud hosting service, uses environment variables, use same database type in development/testing as production, uses custom domain name

## User interface

TODO: User-interface is highly intuitive, with no impediments to user flow.

## Testing

### Development testing

TODO: Evidence of extensive user-testing of development site

### Production testing

TODO: Evidence of extensive user-testing of production site, including by client

### Formal testing framework

TODO: Comprehensive test suite including both unit and integration tests in both backend and frontend, with at least 90% code coverage
